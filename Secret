# Special repository

This special repository will appear on your profile and you can customize it how ever you like.

### How to do that?

Cut to the chase:
* First create a new repository with the same name as your user name for example for me it will be dt170 
* Now you unlocked github secret readme , Don't forget to add README.md .
* You may edit as you like adding gifs, widgets and more !
